1. In calibration mode (Yellow light active), the Sphero forward direction can be set by making a fist and rotating the arm until the blue light is facing the user. 
1. In drive mode (Blue light active), the Sphero will move left or right based off of the roll of the arm and towards or away from the user based off of the pitch.
